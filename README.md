# Alzheimers-Detection-and-Classification-from-MRI-CNN
 This repository contains a Python implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network for Alzheimer's disease detection and classification from MRI images

Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a deep learning model capable of classifying MRI images into different stages of Alzheimer's disease. The implemented CNN uses TensorFlow and Keras for building and training the model.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model is the Dataset-Alzheimer dataset from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserhessein/dataset-alzheimer  
It consists of MRI images categorized into different classes of Alzheimers including Mild Dementia, Moderate Dementia, Non-Dementia, and Very Mild Dementia.

Dependencies
pip install tensorflow numpy matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn pillow
